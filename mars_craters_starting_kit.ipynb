    "\n",
    "Impact craters in planetary science are used to date planetary surfaces, to characterize surface processes and to study the upper crust of terrestrial bodies in our Solar System (Melosh, 1989). Thanks to the Martian crater morphology, a wide amount of information could be deduced on the geological history of Mars, as for example the evolution of the surface erosion rate, the presence of liquid water in the past, the volcanic episodes or the volatiles layer in the subsurface (Carr & Head, 2010). These studies are widely facilitated by the availability of reference crater databases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Surveying impact craters is therefore an important task which traditionally has been achieved by means of visual inspection of images. The enormous number of craters smaller than one kilometer in diameter, present on high resolution images, makes visual counting of such craters impractical. In order to overcome this problem, several algorithms have been developed to automatically detect impact structures on planetary images (Bandeira et al., 2007 ; Martins et al., 2009). Nevertheless, these method allow to detect only 70-80 % of craters (Urbach & Stepinski, 2009)."

We propose to give to the users a subset of this large dataset in order to test and calibrate their algorithm. \n",

First, if it is your first time using RAMP, [sign up](http://www.ramp.studio/sign_up), otherwise [log in](http://www.ramp.studio/login). Then find an open event on the particular problem, for example, the event [MNIST](http://www.ramp.studio/events/MNIST) for this RAMP. Sign up for the event. Both signups are controled by RAMP administrators, so there **can be a delay between asking for signup and being able to submit**.\n",

Save it, rename it, then submit it. The submission is trained and tested on our backend in the same way as `ramp_test_submission` does it locally. While your submission is waiting in the queue and being trained, you can find it in the \"New submissions (pending training)\" table in [my submissions](http://www.ramp.studio/events/MNIST/my_submissions). Once it is trained, you get a mail, and your submission shows up on the [public leaderboard](http://www.ramp.studio/events/MNIST/leaderboard). \n",
    "If there is an error (despite having tested your submission locally with `ramp_test_submission`), it will show up in the \"Failed submissions\" table in [my submissions](http://www.ramp.studio/events/MNIST/my_submissions). You can click on the error to see part of the trace.\n",
